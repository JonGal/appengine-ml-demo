2) Clone this repo locally

git clone https://github.com/JonGal/appengine-ml-demo.git

3) Change to the appengine-ml-demo directory

4) Upload the application into the project you created in the first step

gcloud app deploy app.yaml index.yaml --project <NAMEâ€“OF_PROJECT_YOU_CREATED>

5) You will be prompted to choose a region. Pick one closest to whereever you are demoing.

6) Once the scrip ends, wait at least 15 minutes for all the indexes to finish building.

7) Go back to the Google Console. Choose API Explorer
